This is a drop-in replacement for the proprietary Siemens Skill Matching module.
It works only for the ontology present currently used in the planning framework.

In principle, the planner works without skill matching, but skill matching
provides additional precondition for planning actions.

Format:

Requirements => Offers : Machine

R = {UncappedWorkpiece,RoundWorkpiece}

R => {PutCapOnWorkpieceSkill,BlueCap} : PressCapUnit1
R => {PutCapOnWorkpieceSkill,RedCap} : PressCapUnit1
R => {PutCapOnWorkpieceSkill,WhiteCap} : PressCapUnit2
R => {PutCapOnWorkpieceSkill,RedCap} : PressCapUnit2
